## <b>RTC_Calendar_Init Example Description</b>

Configuration of the LL API to set the RTC calendar. The peripheral initialization uses LL unitary service 
functions for optimization purposes (performance and size).

In this example, after start-up, SYSCLK is configured to the max frequency using the PLL with
HSI as clock source.

This project calls also SCB_EnableICache() and SCB_EnableDCache() functions in order to enable
the Layer 1 Core Instruction and Data Caches.

The RTC peripheral configuration is ensured by the Configure_RTC() function 
(configure of the needed RTC resources according to the used hardware CLOCK, 
PWR, RTC clock source and BackUp). You may update this function to change RTC configuration.

**Note:** LSI oscillator clock is used as RTC clock source by default.

      The user can use also LSE as RTC clock source.
      - The user uncomment the adequate line on the main.c file.
      @code
        #define RTC_CLOCK_SOURCE_LSI  
        /* #define RTC_CLOCK_SOURCE_LSE */
      @endcode
    - Open the ioc file with STM32CubeMX and select :
      LSE as "Crystal/Ceramic Resonator" in RCC configuration.
      LSE as RTC clock source in Clock configuration.
    - Generate code
    LSI oscillator clock is delivered by a 32 kHz RC.
    LSE (when available on board) is delivered by a 32.768 kHz crystal.

Configure_RTC_Calendar function is then called to initialize the 
time and the date.

A key value is written in backup data register 1 to indicate if the RTC is already configured.  
The RTC is in the backup (BKP) domain. It means that when LSE is enabled, even after a reset
done with debugger,  RTC configuration is not lost.

The program behaves as follows:

1. After startup the program checks the backup data register 1 value:

    - BKP_DR1 value not correct: (value is not correct or has not yet
      been programmed when the program is executed for the first time) the RTC is
      configured.
    
    - BKP_DR1 value correct: this means that the RTC is configured and the time
      and date are displayed on Debugger.
      
2. When a reset (except power on reset) occurs the BKP domain is not reset and the RTC 
   configuration is not lost.
   
3. When power on reset occurs:

    - On Nucleo board, as there are no battery connected to the VBAT pin: 
    the BKP domain is reset and the RTC configuration is lost.

LD1 is turned ON when the RTC configuration is done correctly.


The current time and date are updated and displayed on the debugger in aShowTime 
and aShowDate variables (watch or live watch).

- LD3 is toggling : This indicates that the system generates an error.

#### <b>Notes</b>

 1. Whenever the application is using ITCM/DTCM memories (@0x0000000 / @0x20000000: not cacheable and only accessible
    by the Cortex M7 and the GPDMA/HPDMA), there is no need for cache maintenance.
    If the application needs to put DMA buffers in AXI SRAM (starting from @0x24000000), the user has to:
    - either define a non-cacheable region in the MPU and linker configuration file to locate DMA buffers
      (a proposed noncacheable_buffer section is available from CMSIS Device linker template file and its size must
      be adapted to the application requirements)
    - or to ensure cache maintenance operations to ensure the cache coherence between the CPU and the DMAs.

    This is true also for any other data buffers accessed by the CPU and other masters (DMA2D, LTDC)
    The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
    must be properly defined to be aligned to data cache line size (32 bytes) and of a size of being multiple
    of this cache line size.
    - Please refer to the AN4838 "Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs"
    - Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series"
