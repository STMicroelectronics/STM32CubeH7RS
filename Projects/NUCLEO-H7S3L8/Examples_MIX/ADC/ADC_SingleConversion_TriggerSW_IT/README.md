## <b>ADC_SingleConversion_TriggerSW_IT Example Description</b>

How to use ADC to convert a single channel at each SW start,
conversion performed using programming model: interrupt.
This example is based on the STM32H7RSxx ADC HAL and LL API.
The LL API is used for performance improvement.

This example runs from the external Flash memory. It is launched from a first boot stage and inherits from this boot project
configuration (caches, MPU regions [regions 0, 1 and 2 here], system clock at 600 MHz and external memory interface at the highest speed).
Note that the boot part is automatically downloaded from the IDE environment via the board project Templates/Template_XIP/Binary/Boot_XIP.hex file.

Example configuration:

ADC is configured to convert a single channel, in single conversion mode,
from SW trigger.
ADC interruption enabled: EOC (end of conversion of ADC group regular).

Example execution:

From the main program execution, a ADC software start is performed
every second, ADC group regular converts the selected channel.
When conversion is completed ADC interruption occurs.
IRQ handler callback function reads conversion data from ADC data register
and stores it into a variable.
IRQ handler is coded using LL driver for optimized latency of interruption
processing.

LD1 is used to monitor program execution status:

- Normal operation: ADC group regular activity can be observed with LED toggle:
  - At each ADC conversion: LED toggle once (every 1sec)
- Error: LED remaining turned on

Debug: variables to monitor with debugger:

- "uhADCxConvertedData": ADC group regular buffer conversion data (resolution 12 bits)
- "uhADCxConvertedData_Voltage_mVolt": ADC group regular buffer conversion data computed to voltage value (unit: mV)

Connection needed:

Use an external power supply to generate a voltage in range [0V; 3.3V]
and connect it to analog input pin (cf pin below).

Note: If no power supply available, this pin can be let floating (in this case
      ADC conversion data will be undetermined).

Other peripherals used:

  1 GPIO for LD1

  1 GPIO for analog input: ADC channel 10 on pin PC.00 (Arduino A1 pin 3 CN9, Morpho pin 38 CN11)


#### <b>Notes</b>

 1. Whenever the application is using ITCM/DTCM memories (@0x0000000 / @0x20000000: not cacheable and only accessible
    by the Cortex M7 and the GPDMA/HPDMA), there is no need for cache maintenance.
    If the application needs to put DMA buffers in AXI SRAM (starting from @0x24000000), the user has to:
    - either define a non-cacheable region in the MPU and linker configuration file to locate DMA buffers
      (a proposed noncacheable_buffer section is available from CMSIS Device linker template file and its size must
      be adapted to the application requirements)
    - or to ensure cache maintenance operations to ensure the cache coherence between the CPU and the DMAs.
    
	This is true also for any other data buffers accessed by the CPU and other masters (DMA2D, LTDC)
    The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
    must be properly defined to be aligned to data cache line size (32 bytes) and of a size of being multiple
    of this cache line size.
    Please refer to the AN4838 "Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs"
    Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series"

### <b>Hardware and Software environment</b>

  - This example runs on STM32H7S3L8Hx devices.

  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-H7S3L8 board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - User Option Bytes requirement (with STM32CubeProgrammer tool)

    - XSPI2_HSLV=1     I/O XSPIM_P2 High speed option enabled

### <b>How to use it ?</b>

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

**EWARM** and **MDK-ARM**:

 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files from sub-project Appli and load your images into memories: This sub-project will first load Boot_XIP.hex in internal Flash,
   than load Appli part in External memory available on NUCLEO-H7S3L8 board.
 - Run the example

**CubeIDE**:

 - Compile the example/application; the elf file is required to configure the debug profile (the "active configuration" must be "debug", else only assembly debug is available)
 - Open the menu [Run]->[Debug configuration] and double click on  [STM32 C/C++ Application] (it creates a default debug configuration for the current project selected)
 - In [Debugger] tab, section "External  loaders" add the external loader corresponding to your Board/Memory as described below:
 - In "External loaders" section, click on [Add]
 - Select the loader among the available list (**MX25UW25645G_NUCLEO-H7S3L8.stldr** or **MX66UW1G45G_STM32H7S78-DK.stldr**)
 - Option "Enabled" checked and Option "Initialize" unchecked
 - In "Misc" section, uncheck the option "Verify flash download"
 - In [Startup] tab, section "Load Image and Symbols":
   - Click on [Add]
   - If your project contains a boot project:
     - click on "Project" and then select the boot project.
     - click on Build configuration and select "Use active".
     - then select the following options:
       - "Perform build" checked.
       - "Download" checked.
       - "Load symbols" unchecked.
   - If your project doesn't contain a boot project:
     - click on [File System] and select the Boot HEX file corresponding to your board

        Boot_XIP.hex can be found in folder [Binary] on each Template_XIP project

        You may need to force the capability to select a .hex file by typing " * " + pressing the "Enter" key in the file name dialog

     - then select the following options:
       - "Download"      checked.
       - "Load symbols" unchecked.
       - Click Ok
     - Back in the in the [Startup] tab, move down the boot project for it to be in second position
 - Our debug configuration is ready to be used.
