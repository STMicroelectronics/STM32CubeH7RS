## <b>TIM_PWMInput Example Description</b>

How to use the TIM peripheral to measure the frequency and 
duty cycle of an external signal.

The TIM1CLK frequency is set to SystemCoreClock/2 (Hz), the Prescaler is 0 so the 
counter clock is SystemCoreClock/2 (Hz).

This project runs from the external Flash memory. It is launched from a first boot stage and inherits from this boot project
configuration (caches, MPU regions [region 0 and 1], system clock at 600 MHz and external memory interface at the highest speed).
Note that the boot part is automatically downloaded from the IDE environment via the board project Templates/Template_XIP/Binary/Boot_XIP.hex file.

This project calls also SCB_EnableICache() and SCB_EnableDCache() functions in order to enable
the Layer 1 Core Instruction and Data Caches.

TIM1 is configured in PWM Input Mode: the external signal is connected to 
TIM1 Channel2 used as input pin.
To measure the frequency and the duty cycle, we use the TIM1 CC2 interrupt request,
so in the timer IRQ routine (via call to function HAL_TIM_IC_CaptureCallback() ),
the frequency and the duty cycle of the external signal are computed.

"uwFrequency" variable contains the external signal frequency:

TIM1 counter clock = SystemCoreClock/2,

uwFrequency = TIM1 counter clock / TIM1_CCR2 in Hz, 

"uwDutyCycle" variable contains the external signal duty cycle:

uwDutyCycle = (TIM1_CCR1*100)/(TIM1_CCR2) in %.

The minimum frequency value to measure is (TIM1 counter clock / CCR MAX)

                                         = (600 MHz/2)/ 65535

In case of error, LD3 is turned ON.

#### <b>Notes</b>

 1. Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
    based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
    a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
    than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
    To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

 2. This example needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
    to have correct HAL operation.

 3. Whenever the application is using ITCM/DTCM memories (@0x0000000 / @0x20000000: not cacheable and only accessible
    by the Cortex M7 and the GPDMA/HPDMA), there is no need for cache maintenance.
    If the application needs to put DMA buffers in AXI SRAM (starting from @0x24000000), the user has to:
    - either define a non-cacheable region in the MPU and linker configuration file to locate DMA buffers
      (a proposed dma_buffer section is available from CMSIS Device linker template file and its size must
      be adapted to the application requirements)
    - or to ensure cache maintenance operations to ensure the cache coherence between the CPU and the DMAs.

    This is true also for any other data buffers accessed by the CPU and other masters (DMA2D, LTDC)
    The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
    must be properly defined to be aligned to data cache line size (32 bytes) and of a size of being multiple
    of this cache line size.

### <b>Hardware and Software environment</b>

  - This example runs on STM32H7S3L8Hx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics NUCLEO-H7S3L8 
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.

  - User Option Bytes requirement (with STM32CubeProgrammer tool)

    - XSPI2_HSLV=1     I/O XSPIM_P2 High speed option enabled

  - NUCLEO-H7S3L8 Set-up
    - Connect the external signal to measure to the TIM1 CH2 pin (PE11) (connected to pin 6 in CN10 connector).

### <b>How to use it ?</b>

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

**EWARM** and **MDK-ARM**:

 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files from sub-project Appli and load your images into memories: This sub-project will first load Boot_XIP.hex in internal Flash,
   than load Appli part in External memory available on NUCLEO-H7S3L8 board.
 - Run the example

**CubeIDE**:

 - Compile the example/application; the elf file is required to configure the debug profile (the "active configuration" must be "debug", else only assembly debug is available)
 - Open the menu [Run]->[Debug configuration] and double click on  [STM32 C/C++ Application] (it creates a default debug configuration for the current project selected)
 - In [Debugger] tab, section "External  loaders" add the external loader corresponding to your Board/Memory as described below:
 - In "External loaders" section, click on [Add]
 - Select the loader among the available list (**MX25UW25645G_NUCLEO-H7S3L8.stldr** or **MX66UW1G45G_STM32H7S78-DK.stldr**)
 - Option "Enabled" checked and Option "Initialize" unchecked
 - In "Misc" section, uncheck the option "Verify flash download"
 - In [Startup] tab, section "Load Image and Symbols":
   - Click on [Add]
   - If your project contains a boot project:
     - click on "Project" and then select the boot project.
     - click on Build configuration and select "Use active".
     - then select the following options:
       - "Perform build" checked.
       - "Download" checked.
       - "Load symbols" unchecked.
   - If your project doesn't contain a boot project:
     - click on [File System] and select the Boot HEX file corresponding to your board

        Boot_XIP.hex can be found in folder [Binary] on each Template_XIP project

        You may need to force the capability to select a .hex file by typing " * " + pressing the "Enter" key in the file name dialog

     - then select the following options:
       - "Download"      checked.
       - "Load symbols" unchecked.
       - Click Ok
     - Back in the in the [Startup] tab, move down the boot project for it to be in second position
 - Our debug configuration is ready to be used.
