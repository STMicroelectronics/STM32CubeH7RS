## <b>I3C_Target_Direct_Command_DMA Example Description</b>

How to handle a Direct Command procedure between an I3C Controller and an I3C Target,
using Controller in DMA.

      - Board: NUCLEO-H7S3L8's (embeds a STM32H7S3L8Hx device)
      - SCL Pin: PB8 (Arduino SCL/D15 CN7 pin 2, Morpho CN12 pin3)
      - SDA Pin: PB9 (Arduino SDA/D14 CN7 pin 4, Morpho CN12 pin5)
      Connect GND between each board
      Use short wire as possible between the boards or twist an independent ground wire on each I3C lines
      mean one GND twist around SCL and one GND twist around SDA to help communication at 12.5Mhz.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
This project runs from the external Flash memory. It is launched from a first boot stage and inherits from this boot project
configuration (caches, MPU regions [region 0 and 1], system clock at 600 MHz and external memory interface at the highest speed).
Note that the boot part is automatically downloaded from the IDE environment via the board project Templates/Template_XIP/Binary/Boot_XIP.hex file.

This project calls also SCB_EnableICache() and SCB_EnableDCache() functions in order to enable
the Layer 1 Core Instruction and Data Caches.


The I3C peripheral configuration is ensured by the HAL_I3C_Init() function.
This later is calling the HAL_I3C_MspInit()function which core is implementing
the configuration of the needed I3C resources according to the used hardware (CLOCK, GPIO and NVIC).
User may update this function to change I3C configuration.

The I3C communication is then initiated.
The project is split in two workspaces:
the Controller Board (I3C_Controller_Direct_Command_DMA) and the Target Board (I3C_Target_Direct_Command_DMA)

- Target Board
  The HAL_I3C_ActivateNotification() function allow the Target application to be inform when the Controller
  assign a Dynamic Address, Get or Set CCC command code.

  The HAL_I3C_Tgt_Config(), the HAL_I3C_SetConfigFifo(), and the HAL_I3C_ActivateNotification() functions
  allow respectively the configuration of the Target descriptor,
  the configuration of the internal hardware FIFOs and the enabling of Asynchronous catching event in Target mode using Interrupt.

  The Controller send data at 12.5Mhz during Push-pull phase.


In a first step the Target wait the assignation of a proper associated Dynamic Address from the Controller.

In a second step, until Common Command Code procedure from the Controller,
the Target wait in a no activity loop.
Then, at reception of the first Common Code procedure from the Controller,
the Target start the sending or receiving of the CCC additional data depending of Common Command Code.

This sending or receiving of additional data is totally manage by internal hardware state machine,
only end of CCC procedure is treated on software part through the callback HAL_I3C_NotifyCallback().

Each time a Set CCC command is confirmed treated through HAL_I3C_NotifyCallback(),
the associated data is compared with the expected value.

Each time a Get or Set CCC command is confirmed treated through HAL_I3C_NotifyCallback(), the LD1 is toggle.

NUCLEO-H7S3L8's LEDs can be used to monitor the transfer status:
 - LD1 is toggle each time a Command Code process is treated on hardware side.
 - LD1 is toggle slowly when there is an error in Command Code process.  

#### <b>Notes</b>

  1. Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

  2. The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

 3. Whenever the application is using ITCM/DTCM memories (@0x0000000 / @0x20000000: not cacheable and only accessible
    by the Cortex M7 and the GPDMA/HPDMA), there is no need for cache maintenance.
    If the application needs to put DMA buffers in AXI SRAM (starting from @0x24000000), the user has to:
    - either define a non-cacheable region in the MPU and linker configuration file to locate DMA buffers
      (a proposed noncacheable_buffer section is available from CMSIS Device linker template file and its size must
      be adapted to the application requirements)
    - or to ensure cache maintenance operations to ensure the cache coherence between the CPU and the DMAs.
    This is true also for any other data buffers accessed by the CPU and other masters (DMA2D, LTDC)
    The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
    must be properly defined to be aligned to data cache line size (32 bytes) and of a size of being multiple
    of this cache line size.
    Please refer to the AN4838 "Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs"
    Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series"

### <b>How to use it ?</b>

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

 - Rebuild all files and load your image into Controller memory (I3C_Controller_Direct_Command_DMA)
 - Then rebuild all files and load your image into Target memory (I3C_Target_Direct_Command_DMA)
 - Run the Controller in debug mode before run the Target in normal mode.
 This sequence will prevent a false startup phase on Target side
 as there is no high level on the bus, if the Target is started before the Controller.

**EWARM** and **MDK-ARM**:

 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files from sub-project Appli and load your images into memories: This sub-project will first load Boot_XIP.hex in internal Flash,
   than load Appli part in External memory available on NUCLEO-H7S3L8 board.
 - Run the example

**CubeIDE**:

 - Compile the example/application; the elf file is required to configure the debug profile (the "active configuration" must be "debug", else only assembly debug is available)
 - Open the menu [Run]->[Debug configuration] and double click on  [STM32 C/C++ Application] (it creates a default debug configuration for the current project selected)
 - In [Debugger] tab, section "External  loaders" add the external loader corresponding to your Board/Memory as described below:
 - In "External loaders" section, click on [Add]
 - Select the loader among the available list (**MX25UW25645G_NUCLEO-H7S3L8.stldr** or **MX66UW1G45G_STM32H7S78-DK.stldr**)
 - Option "Enabled" checked and Option "Initialize" unchecked
 - In "Misc" section, uncheck the option "Verify flash download"
 - In [Startup] tab, section "Load Image and Symbols":
   - Click on [Add]
   - If your project contains a boot project:
     - click on "Project" and then select the boot project.
     - click on Build configuration and select "Use active".
     - then select the following options:
       - "Perform build" checked.
       - "Download" checked.
       - "Load symbols" unchecked.
   - If your project doesn't contain a boot project:
     - click on [File System] and select the Boot HEX file corresponding to your board

        Boot_XIP.hex can be found in folder [Binary] on each Template_XIP project

        You may need to force the capability to select a .hex file by typing " * " + pressing the "Enter" key in the file name dialog

     - then select the following options:
       - "Download"      checked.
       - "Load symbols" unchecked.
       - Click Ok
     - Back in the in the [Startup] tab, move down the boot project for it to be in second position
 - Our debug configuration is ready to be used.
