## <b>CRC_UserDefinedPolynomial Example Description</b>

How to configure the CRC using the HAL API. The CRC (cyclic
redundancy check) calculation unit computes the 8-bit CRC code for a given
buffer of 32-bit data words, based on a user-defined generating polynomial.
In this example, the polynomial is set manually to 0x9B, that is,
X^8 + X^7 + X^4 + X^3 + X + 1.

This example runs from the external Flash memory. It is launched from a first boot stage and inherits from this boot project
configuration (caches, MPU regions [regions 0, 1 and 2 here], system clock at 600 MHz and external memory interface at the highest speed).
Note that the boot part is automatically downloaded from the IDE environment via the board project Templates/Template_XIP/Binary/Boot_XIP.hex file.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
clock (SYSCLK).

The CRC peripheral configuration is ensured by HAL_CRC_Init() function.
The latter is calling HAL_CRC_MspInit() function which core is implementing
the configuration of the needed CRC resources according to the used hardware (CLOCK).
You can update HAL_CRC_Init() input parameters to change the CRC configuration.

The calculated CRC code is stored in uwCRCValue variable.
Once calculated, the CRC value (uwCRCValue) is compared to the CRC expected value (uwExpectedCRCValue).

STM32 board LEDs are used to monitor the example status:
  - LD1 (GREEN) is ON when the correct CRC value is calculated
  - LD3 (RED) is ON when there is an error in initialization or if an incorrect CRC value is calculated.

#### <b>Notes</b>

1. Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
   based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
   a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
   than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
   To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

2. The example needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
   to have correct HAL operation.

3. Whenever the application is using ITCM/DTCM memories (@0x0000000 / @0x20000000: not cacheable and only accessible
    by the Cortex M7 and the GPDMA/HPDMA), there is no need for cache maintenance.
    If the application needs to put DMA buffers in AXI SRAM (starting from @0x24000000), the user has to:
    - either define a non-cacheable region in the MPU and linker configuration file to locate DMA buffers
      (a proposed noncacheable_buffer section is available from CMSIS Device linker template file and its size must
      be adapted to the application requirements)
    - or to ensure cache maintenance operations to ensure the cache coherence between the CPU and the DMAs.
    This is true also for any other data buffers accessed by the CPU and other masters (DMA2D, LTDC)
    The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
    must be properly defined to be aligned to data cache line size (32 bytes) and of a size of being multiple
    of this cache line size.

### <b>Hardware and Software environment</b>

  - This example runs on STM32H7S3L8Hx devices.
  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-H7S3L8 board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - User Option Bytes requirement (with STM32CubeProgrammer tool)

    - XSPI2_HSLV=1     I/O XSPIM_P2 High speed option enabled

### <b>How to use it ?</b>

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

**EWARM** and **MDK-ARM**:

 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files from sub-project Appli and load your images into memories: This sub-project will first load Boot_XIP.hex in internal Flash,
   than load Appli part in External memory available on NUCLEO-H7S3L8 board.
 - Run the example

**CubeIDE**:

 - Compile the example/application; the elf file is required to configure the debug profile (the "active configuration" must be "debug", else only assembly debug is available)
 - Open the menu [Run]->[Debug configuration] and double click on  [STM32 C/C++ Application] (it creates a default debug configuration for the current project selected)
 - In [Debugger] tab, section "External  loaders" add the external loader corresponding to your Board/Memory as described below:
 - In "External loaders" section, click on [Add]
 - Select the loader among the available list (**MX25UW25645G_NUCLEO-H7S3L8.stldr** or **MX66UW1G45G_STM32H7S78-DK.stldr**)
 - Option "Enabled" checked and Option "Initialize" unchecked
 - In "Misc" section, uncheck the option "Verify flash download"
 - In [Startup] tab, section "Load Image and Symbols":
   - Click on [Add]
   - If your project contains a boot project:
     - click on "Project" and then select the boot project.
     - click on Build configuration and select "Use active".
     - then select the following options:
       - "Perform build" checked.
       - "Download" checked.
       - "Load symbols" unchecked.
   - If your project doesn't contain a boot project:
     - click on [File System] and select the Boot HEX file corresponding to your board

        Boot_XIP.hex can be found in folder [Binary] on each Template_XIP project

        You may need to force the capability to select a .hex file by typing " * " + pressing the "Enter" key in the file name dialog

     - then select the following options:
       - "Download"      checked.
       - "Load symbols" unchecked.
       - Click Ok
     - Back in the in the [Startup] tab, move down the boot project for it to be in second position
 - Our debug configuration is ready to be used.
