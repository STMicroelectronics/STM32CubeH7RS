## <b>DTS_GetTemperature Example Description</b>

How to configure and use the DTS to get the temperature of the die.

      - Board: NUCLEO-H7S3L8 (embeds a STM32H7S3L8Hx device)

This project runs from the external Flash memory. It is launched from a first boot stage and inherits from this boot
project configuration (caches, MPU regions [region 0 and 1], system clock at 600 MHz and external memory interface at
the highest speed).
Note that the boot part is automatically downloaded from the IDE environment via the board project
Templates/Template_XIP/Binary/Boot_XIP.hex file.

The project calls also SCB_EnableICache() and SCB_EnableDCache() functions in order to enable
the Layer 1 Core Instruction and Data Caches. This is provided as template implementation that the User may
integrate in his application in order to enhance the performance.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
clock (SYSCLK) to run at 600 MHz.

The DTS is configured to continuously get the temperature.
The Temperature variable will hold the temperature value in °C unit.
The Temperature value can be displayed on the debugger in "Temperature" variable.

NUCLEO-H7S3L8 board's LEDs can be used to monitor the process status:
  - LD3 toggles and example is stopped (using infinite loop) when there is an error during process.

#### <b>Notes</b>

 1. Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
    based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
    a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
    than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
    To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

 2. The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
    to have correct HAL operation.

 3. Whenever the application is using ITCM/DTCM memories (@0x0000000 / @0x20000000: not cacheable and only accessible
    by the Cortex M7 and the GPDMA/HPDMA), there is no need for cache maintenance.
    If the application needs to put DMA buffers in AXI SRAM (starting from @0x24000000), the user has to:
    - either define a non-cacheable region in the MPU and linker configuration file to locate DMA buffers
      (a proposed dma_buffer section is available from CMSIS Device linker template file and its size must
      be adapted to the application requirements)
    - or to ensure cache maintenance operations to ensure the cache coherence between the CPU and the DMAs.
    This is true also for any other data buffers accessed by the CPU and other masters (DMA2D, LTDC)
    The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
    must be properly defined to be aligned to data cache line size (32 bytes) and of a size of being multiple
    of this cache line size.

### <b>Hardware and Software environment</b>

  - This example runs on STM32H7S3L8Hx devices.

  - This example has been tested with NUCLEO-H7S3L8 board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - User Option Bytes requirement (with STM32CubeProgrammer tool)

    - XSPI2_HSLV=1     I/O XSPIM_P2 High speed option enabled

  - To get the temperature information, put the "Temperature" variable in the debugger watch.

### <b>How to use it ?</b>

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

**EWARM** and **MDK-ARM**:

 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files from sub-project Appli and load your images into memories: This sub-project will first load Boot_XIP.hex in internal Flash,
   than load Appli part in External memory available on NUCLEO-H7S3L8 board.
 - Run the example

**CubeIDE**:

 - Compile the example/application; the elf file is required to configure the debug profile (the "active configuration" must be "debug", else only assembly debug is available)
 - Open the menu [Run]->[Debug configuration] and double click on  [STM32 C/C++ Application] (it creates a default debug configuration for the current project selected)
 - In [Debugger] tab, section "External  loaders" add the external loader corresponding to your Board/Memory as described below:
 - In "External loaders" section, click on [Add]
 - Select the loader among the available list (**MX25UW25645G_NUCLEO-H7S3L8.stldr** or **MX66UW1G45G_STM32H7S78-DK.stldr**)
 - Option "Enabled" checked and Option "Initialize" unchecked
 - In "Misc" section, uncheck the option "Verify flash download"
 - In [Startup] tab, section "Load Image and Symbols":
   - Click on [Add]
   - If your project contains a boot project:
     - click on "Project" and then select the boot project.
     - click on Build configuration and select "Use active".
     - then select the following options:
       - "Perform build" checked.
       - "Download" checked.
       - "Load symbols" unchecked.
   - If your project doesn't contain a boot project:
     - click on [File System] and select the Boot HEX file corresponding to your board

        Boot_XIP.hex can be found in folder [Binary] on each Template_XIP project

        You may need to force the capability to select a .hex file by typing " * " + pressing the "Enter" key in the file name dialog

     - then select the following options:
       - "Download"      checked.
       - "Load symbols" unchecked.
       - Click Ok
     - Back in the in the [Startup] tab, move down the boot project for it to be in second position
 - Our debug configuration is ready to be used.
