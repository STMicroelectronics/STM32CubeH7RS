## <b>ADC_DiscontinuousConversion_TriggerSW Example Description</b>

This example describes how to use an ADC peripheral to perform multiple conversion from different ADC channel,
one at a time after each software trigger.
This example is based on the STM32H7RSxx ADC HAL API.

At the beginning of the main program, the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals and initialize the systick used as 1ms HAL timebase.

This project runs from the external Flash memory. It is launched from a first boot stage and inherits from this boot project
configuration (caches, MPU regions [region 0 and 1], system clock at 600 MHz and external memory interface at the highest speed).
Note that the boot part is automatically downloaded from the IDE environment via the board project Templates/Template_XIP/Binary/Boot_XIP.hex file.

This project calls also SCB_EnableICache() and SCB_EnableDCache() functions in order to enable
the Layer 1 Core Instruction and Data Caches.

Example configuration:

ADC is configured in discontinuous conversion mode, from SW trigger.
Sequencer of ADC group regular (default group available on ADC of all STM32 devices)
is configured to convert 2 channels: 1 channel from GPIO, 1 internal channels:
internal voltage reference VrefInt.

Example execution:

ADC performs conversion of a channel among the 2 channels
of the scan sequence, successively at each conversion start (discontinuous mode enabled).

After each conversion ADC data is stored into the array "uhADCxConvertedData":
- uhADCxConvertedData[0]: ADC channel set on sequence rank 1 (GPIO as analog input)
- uhADCxConvertedData[1]: ADC channel set on sequence rank 2 (VrefInt)

When sequence is completed, ADC raw data are converted physical value then
it restarts from the beginning: first channel in the sequence.

ADC conversions raw data are computed to physical values
using LL ADC driver helper macro:
- Value of analog reference voltage (Vref+), connected to analog voltage supply Vdda (unit: mV)
- Value of voltage on GPIO pin (on which is mapped ADC channel, cf pin below) (unit: mV)
- Value of internal voltage reference VrefInt (unit: mV)

Note: For this example purpose, analog reference voltage (Vref+) is computed
      from ADC conversion of internal voltage reference VrefInt and used
      to compute other conversion data.
      This voltage should correspond to value of literal "VDDA_APPLI".
      This procedure can be performed when value of voltage Vref+
      is unknown in the application.
      (This is not the case in this example due to target board
      supplied by a LDO regulator providing a known constant voltage
      of value "VDDA_APPLI").
      In typical case of Vref+ connected to Vdd, it allows to
      deduce Vdd value.



Debug: variables to monitor with debugger:
- "uhADCxConvertedData": ADC group regular conversion data
- "uhADCxConvertedData_VrefAnalog_mVolt":         Value of analog reference voltage (Vref+), connected to analog voltage supply Vdda (unit: mV)
- "uhADCxConvertedData_VoltageGPIO_mVolt":        Value of voltage on GPIO pin (on which is mapped ADC channel) (unit: mV)
- "uhADCxConvertedData_VrefInt_mVolt":            Value of internal voltage reference VrefInt (unit: mV)

Connection needed:

Use an external power supply to generate a voltage in range [0V; 3.3V]
and connect it to analog input pin (cf pin below).

Note: If no power supply available, this pin can be let floating (in this case
      ADC conversion data will be undetermined).

Other peripherals used:

  1 GPIO for LD1

  1 GPIO for analog input: ADC channel 10 on pin PC.00 (Arduino A1 pin 3 CN9, Morpho PIN 38 CN11)

LD1 is used to monitor program execution status:

- Normal operation: Activity of ADC scan sequence
  can be observed with LED toggle:
  - At each ADC conversion: LED toggle once (every 500ms)
- Error: LED remaining turned on

#### <b>Notes</b>

 1. Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
    based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
    a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
    than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
    To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

 2. The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
    to have correct HAL operation.

 3. Whenever the application is using ITCM/DTCM memories (@0x0000000 / @0x20000000: not cacheable and only accessible
    by the Cortex M7 and the GPDMA/HPDMA), there is no need for cache maintenance.
    If the application needs to put DMA buffers in AXI SRAM (starting from @0x24000000), the user has to:
    - either define a non-cacheable region in the MPU and linker configuration file to locate DMA buffers
      (a proposed noncacheable_buffer section is available from CMSIS Device linker template file and its size must
      be adapted to the application requirements)
    - or to ensure cache maintenance operations to ensure the cache coherence between the CPU and the DMAs.
    This is true also for any other data buffers accessed by the CPU and other masters (DMA2D, LTDC)
    The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
    must be properly defined to be aligned to data cache line size (32 bytes) and of a size of being multiple
    of this cache line size.

### <b>How to use it ?</b>

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

**EWARM** and **MDK-ARM**:

 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files from sub-project Appli and load your images into memories: This sub-project will first load Boot_XIP.hex in internal Flash,
   than load Appli part in External memory available on NUCLEO-H7S3L8 board.
 - Run the example

**CubeIDE**:

 - Compile the example/application; the elf file is required to configure the debug profile (the "active configuration" must be "debug", else only assembly debug is available)
 - Open the menu [Run]->[Debug configuration] and double click on  [STM32 C/C++ Application] (it creates a default debug configuration for the current project selected)
 - In [Debugger] tab, section "External  loaders" add the external loader corresponding to your Board/Memory as described below:
 - In "External loaders" section, click on [Add]
 - Select the loader among the available list (**MX25UW25645G_NUCLEO-H7S3L8.stldr** or **MX66UW1G45G_STM32H7S78-DK.stldr**)
 - Option "Enabled" checked and Option "Initialize" unchecked
 - In "Misc" section, uncheck the option "Verify flash download"
 - In [Startup] tab, section "Load Image and Symbols":
   - Click on [Add]
   - If your project contains a boot project:
     - click on "Project" and then select the boot project.
     - click on Build configuration and select "Use active".
     - then select the following options:
       - "Perform build" checked.
       - "Download" checked.
       - "Load symbols" unchecked.
   - If your project doesn't contain a boot project:
     - click on [File System] and select the Boot HEX file corresponding to your board

        Boot_XIP.hex can be found in folder [Binary] on each Template_XIP project

        You may need to force the capability to select a .hex file by typing " * " + pressing the "Enter" key in the file name dialog

     - then select the following options:
       - "Download"      checked.
       - "Load symbols" unchecked.
       - Click Ok
     - Back in the in the [Startup] tab, move down the boot project for it to be in second position
 - Our debug configuration is ready to be used.
