## <b>ROT_Provisioning DA Description</b>

This section provides an overview of the available scripts for Debug Authentication (DA) usage.

Debug authentication controls debug opening and regressions of the device.<br>
Before using the debug authentication services, the user must provision device with its authentication
secrets.<br>
The debug authentication supports two types of authentication: password or certificates.<br>
The certificates type allows to configure up to 3 levels of permissions.<br>
Debug authentication can then be used when the device is in product state CLOSED to
open debug or perform device regression.

### <b>Notes</b>

The STiRoT/OEMiRoT/STiRoT_OEMuRoT **provisioning processes** are also relying on files present in
this directory for DA configuration.

### <b>Keywords</b>

DA, Password, Certificates, Root of Trust, Security

### <b>Directory contents</b>

<b>Sub-directories</b>

- DA/Binary                             Output binaries and generated images.
- DA/Certificates                       Certificates (3 levels: root, intermediate, leaf).
- DA/Config                             DA configuration files.
- DA/Keys                               Keys (3 levels: root, intermediate, leaf).

<b>Scripts</b>

- DA/dbg_auth.bat/.sh                   Connects to debug authentication.
- DA/ob_programming.bat/.sh             Programs option bytes on the device.
- DA/obk_provisioning.bat/.sh           Programs OBKeys on the device.
- DA/provisioning.bat/.sh               Performs device provisioning process.
- DA/regression.bat/.sh                 Performs full regression of the device.

### <b>Hardware and Software environment</b>

- This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32H7S78-DK (MB1736)
  board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

### <b>How to use it ?</b>

To use DA scripts, you should first configure ROT_Provisioning/env.bat/.sh script (tools path).<br>
The .bat scripts are designed for Windows, whereas the .sh scripts are designed for Linux and Mac-OS.

<b>provisioning.bat/.sh</b>

This script performs the provisioning of debug authentication.<br>
The **provisioning process** (DA/provisioning.bat/.sh) is divided into 3 majors steps:

- Step 1: Configuration
- Step 2: Provisioning
- Step 3: Image flashing

The provisioning script is relying on ob_programming and obk_provisioning scripts.<br>
At the end of the **provisioning process**, the DA is provisioned and the product state is
configured to user choice value (at least CLOSED).

<b>dbg_auth.bat/.sh</b>

This script allows to access debug authentication functionalities.<br>
In password authentication mode, the only accessible functionality is the regression.<br>
In certificate authentication mode, the accessible functionalities depend on DA permission configuration
to open debug access and perform regression.<br>
It requires that product state is not already OPEN (in OPEN the debug is always accessible).

<b>regression.bat/.sh</b>

This script performs the full regression of the device: erases the user flash memory and resets
the product state to OPEN.<br>
It requires that product state is not already OPEN (in OPEN the flash erase is always possible).
