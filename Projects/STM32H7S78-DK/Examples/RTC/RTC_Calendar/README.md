## <b>RTC_Calendar Example Description</b>

Configuration of the calendar using the RTC HAL API.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.

This project runs from the external Flash memory. It is launched from a first boot stage and inherits from this boot project
configuration (caches, MPU regions [region 0 and 1], system clock at 600 MHz and external memory interface at the highest speed).
Note that the boot part is automatically downloaded from the IDE environment via the board project Templates/Template_XIP/Binary/Boot_XIP.hex file.

This project calls also SCB_EnableICache() and SCB_EnableDCache() functions in order to enable
the Layer 1 Core Instruction and Data Caches.

The RTC peripheral configuration is ensured by the HAL_RTC_Init() function.
This later is calling the HAL_RTC_MspInit()function which core is implementing
the configuration of the needed RTC resources according to the used hardware (CLOCK,
PWR, RTC clock source and BackUp). You may update this function to change RTC configuration.

    LSI oscillator clock is used as RTC clock source.
    The user can use also LSE as RTC clock source.
    - The user uncomment the adequate line on the main.h file.
      @code
        #define RTC_CLOCK_SOURCE_LSI
        /* #define RTC_CLOCK_SOURCE_LSE */
      @endcode
    - Open the ioc file with STM32CubeMX and select :
      LSE as "Crystal/Ceramic Resonator" in RCC configuration.
      LSE as RTC clock source in Clock configuration.
    - Generate code
    LSI oscillator clock is delivered by a 32 kHz.
    LSE (when available on board) is delivered by a 32.768 kHz crystal.

HAL_RTC_SetTime()and HAL_RTC_SetDate() functions are then called to initialize the
time and the date.

A key value is written in backup data register 1 to indicate if the RTC is already configured.
The program behaves as follows:

1. After startup the program checks the backup data register 0 value:

    - BKP_DR0 value not correct: (RTC_BKP_DR0 value is not correct or has not yet
      been programmed when the program is executed for the first time) the RTC is
      configured and internal time stamp is enabled.

    - BKP_DR0 value correct: this means that the RTC is configured and the time
      and date are displayed on Debugger.

2. When a reset (except power on reset) occurs the BKP domain is not reset and the RTC
   configuration is not lost. LD2 is ON.

3. When power on reset occurs:

    - The BKP domain is reset and the RTC configuration is lost.

LD1 is turned ON when the RTC configuration is done correctly.

The current time and date are updated and displayed on the debugger in aShowTime
and aShowDate variables.

#### <b>Notes</b>

 1. Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
    based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
    a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
    than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
    To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

 2. The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
    to have correct HAL operation.

 3. Whenever the application is using ITCM/DTCM memories (@0x0000000 / @0x20000000: not cacheable and only accessible
    by the Cortex M7 and the GPDMA/HPDMA), there is no need for cache maintenance.
    If the application needs to put DMA buffers in AXI SRAM (starting from @0x24000000), the user has to:
    - either define a non-cacheable region in the MPU and linker configuration file to locate DMA buffers
      (a proposed noncacheable_buffer section is available from CMSIS Device linker template file and its size must
      be adapted to the application requirements)
    - or to ensure cache maintenance operations to ensure the cache coherence between the CPU and the DMAs.

    This is true also for any other data buffers accessed by the CPU and other masters (DMA2D, LTDC)
    The addresses and the size of cacheable buffers (shared between CPU and other masters)
    must be properly defined to be aligned to data cache line size (32 bytes) and of a size of being multiple
    of this cache line size.
    - Please refer to the AN4838 "Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs"
    - Please refer to the AN4839 "Level 1 cache on STM32F7 Series"

### <b>Hardware and Software environment</b>

  - This example runs on STM32H7S7L8HxH Devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32H7S78-DK
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and
    development board.

  - On STM32H7S78-DK board, the BOOT0 mechanical slide switch must be set to SW1.

  - User Option Bytes requirement (with STM32CubeProgrammer tool):

    - XSPI1_HSLV=1     I/O XSPIM_P1 High speed option enabled
    - XSPI2_HSLV=1     I/O XSPIM_P2 High speed option enabled
    - VDDIO_HSLV=0     I/O speed optimized to operate at 3.3V

### <b>How to use it ?</b>

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :

**EWARM** and **MDK-ARM**:

 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files from sub-project Appli and load your images into memories: This sub-project will first load Boot_XIP.hex in internal Flash,
   than load Appli part in External memory available on NUCLEO-H7S3L8 board.
 - Run the example

**CubeIDE**:

 - Compile the example/application; the elf file is required to configure the debug profile (the "active configuration" must be "debug", else only assembly debug is available)
 - Open the menu [Run]->[Debug configuration] and double click on  [STM32 C/C++ Application] (it creates a default debug configuration for the current project selected)
 - In [Debugger] tab, section "External  loaders" add the external loader corresponding to your Board/Memory as described below:
 - In "External loaders" section, click on [Add]
 - Select the loader among the available list (**MX25UW25645G_NUCLEO-H7S3L8.stldr** or **MX66UW1G45G_STM32H7S78-DK.stldr**)
 - Option "Enabled" checked and Option "Initialize" unchecked
 - In "Misc" section, uncheck the option "Verify flash download"
 - In [Startup] tab, section "Load Image and Symbols":
   - Click on [Add]
   - If your project contains a boot project:
     - click on "Project" and then select the boot project.
     - click on Build configuration and select "Use active".
     - then select the following options:
       - "Perform build" checked.
       - "Download" checked.
       - "Load symbols" unchecked.
   - If your project doesn't contain a boot project:
     - click on [File System] and select the Boot HEX file corresponding to your board

        Boot_XIP.hex can be found in folder [Binary] on each Template_XIP project

        You may need to force the capability to select a .hex file by typing " * " + pressing the "Enter" key in the file name dialog

     - then select the following options:
       - "Download"      checked.
       - "Load symbols" unchecked.
       - Click Ok
     - Back in the in the [Startup] tab, move down the boot project for it to be in second position
 - Our debug configuration is ready to be used.
