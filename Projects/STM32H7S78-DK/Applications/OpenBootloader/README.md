## <b>OpenBootloader Application Description</b>

This application exploits OpenBootloader Middleware to demonstrate how to develop an IAP application
and how use it.

This application supports two workspaces, one runs from FLASH and one runs RAM memory:

- Workspace for user FLASH: compiled application ROM code is programmed in user FLASH and read write data are programmed in SRAM
- Workspace for user SRAM: compiled application ROM code and read write data are programmed in SRAM

At the beginning of the main program, the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock (SYSCLK)
to run at 200 Mhz.

Then, these protocols and memories interfaces are configured:

  - USART4
  - FDCAN2
  - I2C1
  - SPI4
  - USB
  - I3C1
  - FLASH interface
  - RAM interface
  - Option bytes interface
  - Engi bytes interface
  - OTP interface
  - System memory interface
  - flash read only interface
  - External memory interface

Then, the OpenBootloader application will wait for incoming communication on one of the supported protocols.

Once a communication is established through one of the supported protocols,
the OpenBootloader application will wait for commands sent by the host.

#### <b>Notes</b>

1. The current implementation of write in option bytes doesnâ€™t support writing in OEMKEYR option bytes. The OEMKEYR option bytes registers programming can be easily added at the end of the function `OPENBL_OB_Write` in the file `optionbytes_interface.c`.

2. In case of Mass Erase operation, the OpenBootloader FLASH area must be protected otherwise the OpenBootloader will be erased.

3. In the `OpenBootloader_Init()` function in `app_openbootloader.c` file, the user can:
       - Select the list of supported commands for a specific interface by defining its own list of commands.

       Here is an example of how to customize USART interface commands list, here only read/write commands are supported:

        OPENBL_CommandsTypeDef USART_Cmd =
        {
          NULL,
          NULL,
          NULL,
          OPENBL_USART_ReadMemory,
          OPENBL_USART_WriteMemory,
          NULL,
          NULL,
          NULL,
          NULL,
          NULL,
          NULL,
          NULL,
          NULL,
          NULL,
          NULL,
          NULL,
          NULL,
          NULL,
          NULL,
          NULL
        };

        USART_Handle.p_Ops = &USART_Ops;
        USART_Handle.p_Cmd = &USART_Cmd;           /* Initialize the USART handle with the list of supported commands */
        OPENBL_USART_SetCommandsList(&USART_Cmd);  /* Register the list of supported commands in MW side */

       - Use the default list of supported commands for a specific interface by reusing the commands list defined in MW side.

       Here is an example of how to use USART interface default commands list:

        /* Register USART interfaces */
        USART_Handle.p_Ops = &USART_Ops;
        USART_Handle.p_Cmd = OPENBL_USART_GetCommandsList();  /* Initialize the USART handle with the default list supported commands */
