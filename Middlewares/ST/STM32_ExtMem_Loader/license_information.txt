Question:
========
The External Memory Loader is delivered to me under ST Ultimate Liberty (SLA0044)
license that is basically an ST proprietary license. However, several files
delivered in this component have an Apache 2.0 license header most often
with an IAR Systems or Arm Limited copyright declaration. Why? What license
terms do actually apply for those files and more generally for the External
Memory Loader?

Answer:
======
As stated in the External Memory Loader documentation you must have received,
External Memory Loader uses or relies on several components provided
by IAR Systems and Arm Limited such as the definition of the structure to
build an external memory loader for their IDEs, all licensed under Apache
2.0 license.

Apache 2.0 license authorizes that “Derivative Works as a whole” using Apache 2.0
code to be delivered with another license provided compatibility is respected.
This is the case as we deliver the External Memory Loader to you under SLA0044 license.
Particularly, Apache 2.0 license requires that:
1.	We give to you a copy of this License: this is available in the
    APACHE-2.0.txt file at the root of the External Memory Loader; and
2.	We cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that we
    changed the files: these are the files modified by us with the addition of
	STMicroelectronics copyright to the original IAR Systems and Arm Limited copyright; and
3.	We retain, in the Source form that we distribute, all copyright and
    attribution notices from the original Source form of the Work: this is the
	reason why IAR Systems and Arm Limited original copyright declarations
	and license heading have been retained; and
4.	Any Derivative Works that we distribute must include a readable copy of the
    attribution notices contained within original work, in at least one of
	three possible places (within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the
	Derivative Works, within the Source form or documentation or within a
	display generated by the Derivative Works): we deliver to you the readable
	copy of the attribution notices within the Source form.

As a conclusion, we confirm that the External Memory Loader is licensed under SLA0044
license terms and that they use parts of IAR Systems and Arm Limited copyrighted
components originally licensed under Apache 2.0 license. Respecting the original
Apache 2.0 license terms obliges us to retain IAR Systems or Arm Limited copyright
declarations as well as Apache 2.0 file headers.
